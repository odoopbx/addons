Asterisk Plus Installation
==========================

.. contents::

In order to connect Asterisk and Odoo a special middleware Agent is required to be
installed on the Asterisk server.  The source of this file is located at our Documenation - https://docs.odoopbx.com/install/docker.html.

The Agent does the following jobs:

* Forwards Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) events to Odoo according to the downloaded events map.
* Executes Asterisk AMI actions received from Odoo.
* Protects Asterisk from DDoS and password bruteforce attacks.(optionally, disabled by default).
* Manages the installation & upgrade process.

The most simple way to install the Agent is to use docker compose style setup but a general server
wide installation is also supported.

Below both installation methods are described.

Docker based installation
=========================
This setup assumes that both Odoo and Asterisk are already installed and running outside docker.

So in this case you should do the following steps:

* Open on firewall Salt API port (default 48008) and WEB CLI port (default 30000).
* Supply a configuration file for Odoo & Asterisk.
* Change the default Sapt API password.

Let review these steps in more details.

.. code::

    version: '3.1'
    services:

  pbx:
    hostname: pbx
    image: odoopbx/pbx
    network_mode: host
    # Required to manage host's ipsets (if reactor is enabled).
    privileged: true
    environment:
      - ASTERISK_AUTOSTART=false
    volumes:
      - ./minion_local.conf:/etc/salt/minion_local.conf
      - ./auth:/etc/salt/auth
      - /var/spool/asterisk:/var/spool/asterisk
      - /etc/asterisk:/etc/asterisk
      - /var/run/asterisk:/var/run/asterisk
  
Before starting this file create custom ``minion_local.conf`` and ``auth`` files (see below).

Custom minion_local.conf configuration file
###########################################
Here is an example of  ``minion_local.conf``:

.. code:: yaml

    odoo_host: odoo # Put IP address or hostname here.    
    odoo_user: asterisk1 # It's ok to leave the default user name.
    odoo_password: asterisk1 # This is the default password set on addon installation. CHANGE IT here and in Odoo!!!
    odoo_db: my_database # Replace to your real Odoo database name.
    odoo_port: 8069 # If your Odoo is behind a proxy put 80 or 443 here.
    odoo_use_ssl: False # Set it to True only if Odoo is behind a proxy with HTTPS enabled.
    # Asterisk settings.
    ami_login: odoo
    ami_secret: your-ami-secret-here
    ami_port: 5038
    ami_host: localhost # Your Asterisk host. Most common value is 127.0.0.1.

Change the default Salt API password
####################################
The Salt API password is stored in ``/etc/salt/auth`` file. Generate a new password like that:

.. code:: bash

  echo -n "salt-api-new-pass" | md5sum

Save this password in ``auth`` file:

.. code::

  odoo|bf67d5d35021cb370bcbfb046f6c437f

Now your are ready for a test run:

.. code:: sh

  docker-compose up pbx

Check the output. If there is no error messages, press CTRL+C and restart the Agent in background mode:

.. code:: sh

    docker-compose up -d pbx

Debug the Agent connection
##########################
Agent is built-up from three processes:

* Salt API
* Salt master
* Salt minion

The processes are started by the Supervisor daemon.

So in order to debug a process you first have to enter the container using

.. code::
  
  docker-compose exec pbx bash

Now stop the required process. Usually we want to debug the salt-minion process so we stop it and
run in debug mode:  

.. code::
  
  supervisorctl stop salt-minion
  salt-minion -l debug

You can press ``CTRL+C`` to terminate the process and restart again in normal mode:
.. code::

  CTRL+C
  supervisorctl stort salt-minion

Then you can exit the container with ``CTRL+d``.

Asterisk Dialplan configuration
===============================

Asterisk Plus exposes additional functionality by providing the following controllers:

#. You can get the contact's name by accessing ``asterisk_plus/get_caller_name``
#. If the Contact for the phone number has a manager set, use ``asterisk_plus/get_partner_manager`` to get the manager's number.
#. You can get the Contact's tags by using ``/asterisk_plus/get_caller_tags``

Here are some examples of integration, using Asterisk dialplans.
`Here <https://github.com/odoopbx/agent/blob/master/salt/asterisk/files/configs/extensions.conf>`__ is 
the latest version of the below example.

``extensions.conf``:
